This directory contains tools used to turn word lists and frequency data files into the dictionary
and statistics files required by the main game:

- **[`fix.js`](fix.js)**: Builds `data/freqs.txt` which is a file of all the words from the source
  word lists (NWL, [CSW](../data/csw.2019.txt), [Enable](../data/enable.txt)) sorted by how often
  they appear in the English language as measured by existing frequency lists
  ([ngram](../data/freq.ngram.txt), [BNC](../data/freq.bnc.txt)).

      $ node tools/fix.js # produces data/freqs.txt

- **[`dict.js`](dict.js)**: Based off of the words found in `data/freqs.txt`, fills in definitions
for the words that are found in [CSW](../data/csw.2019.txt) and assigns each word and its anagrams
scores based on how often they showed up in scoring tables generated by `gen.sh`:

      $ node tools/dict.js # produces data/{dict,stats}.json

  **NOTE**: `dict.js` must be run before `gen.sh` so that `data/dict.json` exists, but at this point
  it will still be using the old `{big,new,dict}.txt` scoring tables and thus will need to be run
  again *after* `combine.js` combines the `gen.sh` output into new scoring tables.

- **[`gen.sh`](gen.sh)**: Runs [`gen.js`](gen.js) for each dice configuration and with different
seed offsets to compute tables of how often the words in `data/dict.json` appeared in random game
statswhich it writes to a `results` directory that must be created beforehand. `gen.js` also depends
on the compiled classes from the main game - run `npm run compile` first.

      $ npm run compile && cd tools && mkdir results && ./gen.sh 1000 # produces results/*.json

- **[`combine.js`](combine.js)**: Combines the total word occurrences accross the various and scales
them by the score of the word to produce `{big,new,dict}.txt` scoring tables which can then be used
as input to `dict.js` to build a new `data/stats.json` database.

      $ node tools/fix.js # produces data/{big,new,dict}.txt
