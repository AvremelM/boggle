      <h1><a href='/'>Boggle</a></h1> 

      <p>Boggle is a word game in which players attempt to find words in
      sequences of adjacent letters. Unlike the numerous other online
      implementations of the Boggle game (which are often released under various
      different names to avoid trademark infringement), this application exists
      to provide a lightweight, minimalistic user interface and power-user
      features which aim to help a player improve.</p>

      <p>Boggle can be played in any modern browser or device. The
      implementation relies on the Service Worker API to ensure it will work
      completely offline, and can be installed to one's desktop or phone home
      screen if desired.</p>

      <p>The Boggle application opens to a menu, providing the options to play
      a game, train your vocabulary, define a word, view stats from past games,
      or change the settings.</p>

      <h3 id="play">Play</h3>

      <p>While playing, the standard 3 minute timer ticks down (which may be
      paused or restarted at any point simply by clicking it) and a refresh
      button can be found in the top left corner which will end the current game
      and begin a new one with a randomly generated board. In the top right
      corner the player’s current score is displayed. Words may be entered on a
      touch device by touching letters on the board and dragging across the
      tiles to complete words - once the touch ends the word is considered
      finished. On devices with a keyboard, words may be entered simply by
      typing, the ‘Enter’ or ‘Space’ key can be used to complete the word.</p>

      <p>By default, after a word has been entered:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li>if the word is valid and has not yet been played a definition for
          the word will be displayed and persist until another word has been
          entered</li>
        <li>if the word is valid and has already been played, or the word is
          shorter than the configured minimum word size the word will disappear
          immediately after being played</li>
        <li>if the word is invalid the word will flash red and disappear</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The application allows words to be entered even after the timer has
      expired, though it keeps track of which words were entered before the
      game’s duration elapsed and scores them separately (see example above).
      </p>

      <p>The application also provides some ‘power user’ features during
      gameplay in the form of shortcuts and heatmap hints. To simplify and
      expedite word entry, given that the minimum length of word supported by
      the application is 2 letters, anytime a 1 or 2 letter word is played the
      game will interpret it as if it were intended to be appended as a suffix
      to the word which had just been entered previously (the ‘ING’ suffix is
      also handled as a special case for this shortcut). The most common use
      case for this is quickly entering plurals of words (~50% of all valid
      words are plurals), though any suffixes can take advantage of the
      shortcut:</p>

      <p>The heatmap hint feature is more situational - during game play, a
      player may long press the score displayed in the top right corner to cause
      the application to colour the tiles based on how frequently they occur
      (more precisely, the points the tile is involved in) in the remaining
      possible words that can be played. The tiles opacity is weighted such that
      those which are present in words forming the most points in aggregate will
      show up in the most opaque red for the duration of the press. While there
      are some rare edge cases when words may be found more than one way on a
      given board, in general the heatmap can be used to help a player determine
      where to focus their search to maximize their score.</p>

      <h3 id="score">Score</h3>

      <p>Clicking on the score (as opposed to long pressing it) will instead
      display a full breakdown of which words were played, for the current game
      and for each game that has ever been played by the user in reverse
      chronological order.</p>

      <p>Each game’s ID can be seen in the list, though only the current game’s
      ‘Played’ section will be expanded by default, other games or sections can
      be expanded or collapsed via clicking on them. A game’s ID contains
      information about the dice configuration, minimum board size, dictionary
      and the random seed used to generate the board - this ID can be shared
      with another player for them to be able to play the same board and compare
      results. Alongside the ID is the players total score (irrespective of the
      timer) for the game compared to their configured ‘goal’ score (also
      rendered as a percentage).</p>

      <p>The ‘Played’ section summary contains several metrics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the potential score (in parentheses) the player could have had if
          they had played all of the words described next (note: a word will
          only be counted in the first group it falls into)</li>
        <li>the total number (not points) of suffixes that were missed, computed
          roughly by determining which of the player’s words could also have had
          ‘S’, ‘ED’, ‘ER’, or ‘ING’ applied to them to form further valid words.
          This is sometimes misleading as these suffixes may actual form
          completely new valid words which aren’t actually extensions stemming
          from the original root (eg. ‘BAS’ -&gt; ‘BASS’ or ‘SAT’ -&gt; ‘SATED’),
          but in general works as a good enough heuristic</li>
        <li>the number of subwords of words played which were not played
          themselves (eg. if ‘SETA’ was played not ‘ETA’)</li>
        <li>the number of anagrams of words played which were not played
          themselves though were present in the board</li>
        <li>the ratio of invalid words played versus the total number of words
          (invalid and valid) played (also in parentheses)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These summary metrics can be completely ignored, but they may also
      serve as helpful metrics for players looking to improve their play and
      detect weaknesses. Finally, the ‘Possible’ section summary simply lists
      the total number of points attainable using only words of a specific grade
      level or below, ie. ‘D / C / B / A (S)’. Due to the nature of the grading
      system, the final score in parentheses also indicates the highest possible
      score for the given board in question.</p>

      <p>Upon expanding the ‘Played’ section, words played by the user are
      listed in the order that they were entered, along with any definitions.
      Invalid words show up in red and words which are of a higher grade level
      than the goal grade configured by the user show up in grey.</p>

      <p>The ‘Possible’ section lists all of the words possible in the board
      which were not already played by the user, though these are sorted by a
      more complicated procedure: words which were determined as ‘missed’
      (suffixes/subwords/anagrams as described above in the section on ‘Played’
      metrics) are shown at the top (and underlined), then the words are sorted
      by grade, length, grouped together with their anagrams and then sorted
      alphabetically. This sort order attempts to make it easy for a player to
      prioritize learning which words were overlooked.</p>

      <h3 id="stats">Stats</h3>

      <p>To further aid with post game analysis, a ‘stats’ breakdown of
      commonly missed words, anadromes and anagrams from recent games can be
      accessed by clicking on the score in the top right of the score breakdown
      (or via the main application menu).</p>

      <p> he sort order for these tables attempts to surface words worth the
      most points per game that have been missed most recently. The ‘Words’ tab
      shows the commonly missed words and how often they have been found
      relative to how often they were possible, the ‘Anadromes’ tab shows how
      often one direction of an anadrome pair has been found relative to
      another, and the ‘Anagrams’ tab shows how often a specific word has been
      found relative to how often it has been present compared to the stats of
      its anagrams.</p>

      <h3 id="define">Define</h3>

      <p>By either navigating through the main menu, swiping left or right
      anywhere in the application outside of the game board, or by using the ‘?’
      keyboard shortcut the ‘define’ panel can be pulled up: </p>

      <p>Words will be defined immediately as they are typed. Words that are
      recognized in certain configurations but not the current configuration
      will be greyed out. In addition to definitions, all valid anagrams of the
      search term will be displayed (and may be clicked to link to their
      definition), as will various statistics for the defined word:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Grade: words are assigned an artificial grade (S, A, B, C, D) meant
          to reflect their difficulty/importance based on the frequency they
          occur in the English language and how frequently they show up in
          Boggle games. Each grade corresponds roughly 20 percentile points worth
          of ‘weight’, eg. a player who knows all B, C and D (and no S or A)  tier
          words would be expected to roughly recognize 60% of the possible points on
          any given Boggle board.</li>
        <li>Frequency: the percentile ranking of the word in the English
          language, based on n-gram data provided by Peter Norvig, where a lower
          percentile means the word is more common. While this frequency data
          needs to be taken with a grain of salt, it does an OK job of separating
          more regular words from those that are truly esoteric.</li>
        <li>Score: the percentile ranking of the word based on its expected
          number of points per game (see below for a further elaboration on this
          concept).</li>
        <li>Anagram: the percentile ranking of the word based on the expected
          number of points per game for it and all of its anagrams.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A user can return out of define mode either by swiping left or right
      or hitting the ‘Escape’ key.</p>

      <h3 id="settings">Settings</h3>

      <p>The settings pane can be accessed via the main menu or through long
      pressing on the refresh button at any point. Because it is often accessed
      mid game, the current game’s timer is displayed at the top, and a icon to
      navigate to training mode exists in the top right (though training mode
      can also be accessed via the main menu).</p>

      <p>The current game’s ID (which, as described above, contains information
      about the the dice configuration, minimum board size, dictionary and the
      random seed used to generate the board) is displayed and can be edited
      manually, though as the various setting options are toggled the seed
      updates itself to reflect the changes. Setting changes can be applied by
      clicking the refresh icon in the top left to return to the new board (or
      the ‘back’ icon can be clicked to return to an existing one if the
      settings changes do not mandate a refresh).</p>

      <p>The Boggle board game has been released with various dice
      configurations over the years. This implementation supports the three most
      common English dice distributions, including the 5x5 distribution for 'Big
      Boggle'. The 6x6 'Super Big Boggle' distribution is not supported.</p>

      <p>4x4 configurations of Boggle typically mandate that a legal word must
      be at least 3 characters long, with the 5x5 Big Boggle further restricting
      the legal word size to at least 4 characters. This implementation follows
      these defaults, but also allows the player to change the minimum word
      length restriction independent of board size, allowing 3, 4, or 5 letter
      words to be the minimum allowed.</p>

      <p>Boggle has no official dictionary, so instead this implementation
      relies on the three canonical Scrabble word lists - NWL (formerly known as
      ‘TWL’, more restrictive, used in American and Canadian Scrabble
      tournaments), ENABLE (similar to NWL, used by a large number of online
      games), and CSW (formerly known as ‘SOWPODS’ the most permissive word
      list, used by Scrabble players outside of North America). By default, the
      NWL is used (though it is important to note that due to availability all
      definitions come from CSW which may sometimes be a source of confusion).
      </p>

      <p>The grade toggle simply allows a player to choose which grade (as
      described in detail above) best reflects the breadth of their vocabulary
      and is only used for display purposes when determining goal points or
      visually styling words.</p>

      <p>The display toggle changes how much information the player sees during
      a game. The ‘Hide’ mode more accurately reflects how games are played in
      real life - all words entered will disappear immediately instead of
      lingering with a definition if they were valid or displaying in red if
      they were invalid, and the current score is not displayed at all times. To
      find out these details the user must navigate to the scoring breakdown. On
      the opposite end of the spectrum is the ‘Full’ display mode which pulls
      out the metrics from the scoring breakdown and places them front and
      center for easy access while playing. From left to right, the potential
      score, number of missed suffixes, number of missed subwords, number of
      missed anagrams, points scored, goal score and percentage of goal score
      are displayed (a hybrid of what is displayed alongside game ID in the
      scoring breakdown and the ‘Played’ section summary).</p>

      <p>Finally, light and dark themes are supported for the application,
      though the application will respect the system’s default preference until
      it is overwritten in the settings.</p>

      <h3 id="settings">Training</h3>

      <p>The final feature the application provides is a ‘training’ mode,
      accessible via the main menu or settings. Training mode respects the
      settings configured in the settings pane (dice configuration, minimum word
      length, dictionary) and effectively amounts to ‘anagram flashcards’ -
      users are presented with a jumble of letters to form words out of and by
      touching anywhere on the screen they can see all of the possible valid
      words and their definitions. At the bottom of the answer card users are
      asked to assign a rating to how well they remembered the card - the
      application will use this rating and the user’s past ratings of this
      anagram group to determine when it will next be tested. A recommended
      rubric for assigning the numerical ratings based on the original paper for
      the algorithm is as follows:</p>

      <table id="rating">
        <tr><td>5</td><td>perfect response <em>(obvious, knew words and exact number in group immediately)</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td>4</td><td>correct response after a hesitation <em>(default correct rating, able to name entire group)</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td>3</td><td>correct response recalled with serious difficulty <em>(took a long time, possibly required size hint or named words not in the group)</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td>2</td><td>incorrect response; where the correct one seemed easy to recall <em>(~80% or more of the group remembered fairly easily, missing words familiar)</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td>1</td><td>incorrect response; the correct one remembered <em>(default incorrect rating, no words seem completely foreign)</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td>0</td><td>complete blackout <em>(less than 20-30% of words remembered and some words totally unrecognized)</em></td></tr>
      </table>

      <p>New anagram groups are introduced in order of priority based on their
      expected points per game, and the spaced repetition algorithm used is a
      modification of those used by existing memorization software applications
      like Anki, Duolingo, Quizlet or Memrise. Similar standalone game specific
      word study software exists (eg. ‘NASPA Zyzzyva’ or ‘Scrabble Expert’), but
      none leverage the expected points per game data available in Boggle to
      focus on the most important words. A detailed description of how the
      training algorithm works can be found in the Appendix.</p>

      <p>The count in the top right corner of the training mode displays the
      number of anagram groups that the player has been exposed to during
      training, and similar to the ‘heatmap’ hint during game play, the count
      can be long pressed to reveal a hint indicating the number of valid words
      that are possible to form by unscrambling the letters being tested. By
      simply clicking on the count instead of long pressing, a ‘review’ page
      where anagram groups which are currently troublesome to the user is
      displayed.</p>

      <h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>

      <h3 id="strategy">Strategy</h3>

      <p>The core skill in most word games (eg. Boggle, Scrabble, Bananagrams)
      is being able to find possible words from a jumble of letters - that is,
      to determine valid anagrams. Having a substantive vocabulary is important,
      but the type of vocabulary required is vastly different than the type of
      vocabulary that may be useful for passing the SAT or GRE - long words
      occur with significantly less regularity. Shorter words, particularly
      those involving specific letters, tend to be the most valuable to focus
      one’s studying on.</p>

      <p>In Bananagrams and Scrabble, knowledge of 2-letter words is incredibly
      important as it allows much more flexibility in playing longer words
      alongside those which already exist. Memorizing all valid 2-letter words
      is actually fairly straightforward, Tom Rees outlines a way of remembering
      them through use mnemonics, an example of which (updated for NWL 2019) can
      be found below:</p>

      <table class="mnenomic">
        <tr><td>dumpy biz thankful</td><td>a</td><td>birthdays mangle wax</td></tr>
        <tr><td>few behind him party</td><td>e</td><td>homosexual snowdrifts</td></tr>
        <tr><td>quake halts bag mixup</td><td>i</td><td>infested</td></tr>
        <tr><td>midnight jeep bylaws</td><td>o</td><td>murky pushdown fix</td></tr>
        <tr><td>x-men</td><td>u</td><td>phantoms </td></tr>
        <tr><td>mm hm by my sh</td><td></td><td>aa ae ai oe oi</td></tr>
      </table>

      <p>As described in the article, a player simply needs to remember the
      phrases for each of the vowels (and the leftover words at the bottom), and
      they will be able to determine if a combination of two letters is a valid
      word or not. Actually knowing the definition of said 2-letter word is
      irrelevant (case in point, a New Zealander who speaks no French won the
      French-language Scrabble world championship), though learning the words’
      definitions can be helpful for further ingraining it in one’s memory or
      making it easier to recognize as a word.</p>

      <p>2-letter words can also be relatively useful in 4x4 Boggle play, as
      many of these words can take an ‘-S’ suffix, giving one a jump start on
      learning the 3-letter words. Playing a letter before or after an existing
      word is known as “hooking”, and it is already demonstrated in the table
      above, as the consonants which can be ‘hooked’ onto a vowel are encoded in
      the phrases. In Scrabble and Bananagrams, hooking is central to the game
      as it's the only way a player is able to play their word - they must build
      off an existing word. In Boggle, the concept of hooks is still useful for
      building up one’s vocabulary in more manageable pieces and also in game -
      after discovering a pocket of tiles, one can then look around the
      neighbouring tiles for known hooks to potential form additional words.
      </p>

      <p>In Scrabble and Bananagrams, learning the 2- and 3-letter words and
      their hooks (and especially which can be pluralized) is usually the best
      place to start, as we can assume these words will appear most frequently
      and be used to join new words to the board. With Boggle, these words are
      still important (and there’s only ~1000 3-letter words), but Boggle
      actually has a unique property compared to the other games in that the
      state of the board is completely determined from the beginning of the
      game, independent of input from the players. As such, one can actually
      randomly generate hundreds of millions of boards and track which words
      occur most often in aggregate, and then use the expected points each word
      will garner in an average game to prioritize which to study first (thanks
      to Luke Gustafson and Craig S. Kaplan for this idea).</p>

      <p>The word frequency stats from Boggle games in aggregate shows that
      most words on a board are going to be 3-7 characters long, with the most
      between 3-5 (or 4-6 in Big Boggle). As such, Boggle favours the ability to
      recognize to an even greater extent than Bananagrams or Scrabble where
      longer words have more advantages. There are several other important
      tactical considerations when playing or learning Boggle:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Anagrams: as mentioned from the beginning, deciphering various
          anagrams from scrambled letters is the core of word games. In Boggle,
          if a player encounters a cluster of letters and recognizes one word
          from an anagram group, the player can then test to see if any of the
          other words that are known anagrams of the word played can also be
          played. This narrows the search dramatically from one which is more
          exploratory to one which is surgical in nature and greatly speeds up
          identifying words and helps avoid overlooking words.</li>
        <li>Anadromes: a special case of anagram, anadromes form ‘pairs’ which
          can simplify learning and playing words to a great extent - unlike
          anagram groups where some members of the group may not be playable due
          to the configuration of the board, if a player finds one half of an
          anadrome pair they immediately know that its partner must exist and
          can write down the partner word without even looking at the board.
          Furthermore, anadromes simplify memorizing words considerably, as its
          only necessary to remember a word has an anadrome, not what the
          anadrome means or even looks like. eg. A player who remembers that
          ‘LION’ has an anadrome can immediately write down the reverse of
          ‘LION’ (‘NOIL’, “short fibers combed from long fibers during textile
          preparation”), effectively reducing the amount of information they
          need to memorize from being an entire other word to simply an extra bit
          of information attached to a word they already know.</li>
        <li>Subwords: players will more often look to build longer words through
          hooking and sometimes miss looking inside the words they’ve already
          found: eg. missing ‘LOO’ after jumping immediately to ‘LOOT’. This
          often occurs when the subword is more esoteric than the longer word
          (‘OPE’ vs. ‘OPEN’).</li>
        <li>Search Optimization: players should aim to spend most of their time
          looking in the areas of the board most likely to contain the most
          scoring words, which often means not spending too much time trying to
          make words out ‘Qu’, ‘K’, ‘Z’, etc and instead looking to build around
          vowels and other promising groups of characters.</li>
        <li>Suffixes/Prefixes: one of the most basic strategies players learn
          for Boggle is to always been on the lookout to see if a common suffix
          such as  ‘-S’, ‘-ER’, ‘-ED’,  or ‘-ING’ exists on the board and then
          trying to look for words around those suffixes. This is effectively a
          combination of hooking and looking in areas likely to have higher
          clusters of points. This practice can also be applied to common
          prefixes such as ‘RE-’ or ‘DE-’, though these occur with less
          regularity than the suffixes mentioned above (it’s also worth noting
          that ‘-ING’ isn’t actually that common a suffix when you take into
        account dice distributions and expected points per game).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Playing games like Bananagrams and Scrabble involve slightly different
      strategies, including:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Dumping: stronger players tend to be more willing to take the tradeoff of missing their turn/gaining more letters to get rid of a bad slate of tiles. In Scrabble, longer words (and especially bingos) that you can more easily play to stretch to word bonuses are going to earn disproportionately more points in the long run. In both games, trading off undesirable letters in the hopes of achieving a better composition of characters to work with is an important skill to master.</li>
        <li>Difficult Letters: while knowing when to dump difficult letters is important, players should also take care to study the easiest ways to utilize these letters in their play. While in Boggle difficult letters can (and for the most part, should) be avoided, in Scrabble and Bananagrams you are often placed in a position where you are to come up with a use for a ‘Q’ or ‘Z’ or need a word that uses up an excess of consonants or vowels. In Bananagrams it is worth considering leaving open an ‘A’, ‘I’, or ‘O’ available be able to use in case a ‘Z’, ‘K’, ‘X’, ‘Q’ or ‘J’ arises. In Scrabble, more difficult letters are assigned higher points, so it is often worth saving them to play on bonus squares and learning how to use them in longer words such that they can actually serve as a benefit rather than a roadblock.</li>
        <li>Open Board Position: high level Scrabble and Bananagram players will look to build a board that is as ‘open’ as possible, favoring longer words sprawled out as opposed to a board which is compact and hard to play off of. An open board position provides more opportunities to play high scoring words in Scrabble (and in particular, to reach bonus squares on the board) and provides more space to play words in Bananagrams.</li>
        <li>Restructuring: in Bananagrams a player should constantly be willing to restructure their board as needed. The board state in Bananagrams is not set in stone, once played a word may later be removed and rearranged to form other words. Because of this, players should always be on the lookout for opportunities to remove words in order to build long words from the tiles (to achieve a more open board position, as discussed above) and, in particular, to use difficult letters. A very powerful tactic in Bananagrams for dealing with a difficult letter is to find a place for it in your existing board by swapping out a more common and easy to use letter, with the expectation that it will be much easier to then find a new home for the letter it replaced.</li>
        <li>Bonuses/Bingos: word/letter bonuses (eg. triple letter score) and bingos (when a player uses all 7 of their tiles in one turn and earns a 50 point bonus) are incredibly important to consider at higher level play - among experts the winner, on average, out-bingos the loser 2:1. Maintaining an open board position as mentioned above is important for facilitating this, but for Scrabble it’s also important to study the most common 6-7 letter stems that can be turned into bingos. Old Town Scrabble explains bingo stems in more detail,  but for example, 70 other words can be made by the addition of one letter to the 6 tiles in ‘SATIRE’.</li>
      </ul>


      <h3 id="training-algorithm">Training Algorithm</h3>

      <p>Words are learned alongside their anagrams, with new groups being
      introduced in order of the groups’ average total expected points per game.
      The trainee’s ratings are then plugged into the standard SM2 algorithm,
      with a small number of enhancements and the now standard 3 day review
      period. Like with Anki, failures during the initial ‘learning’ phase of a
      group (the first 5 times the group has been seen) are treated less
      harshly, with the modifier applied to the difficulty rating only
      progressively approaching its full value. Furthermore, if a group is
      corrected remembered after its due date, a bonus is applied to reduce its
      difficulty.</p>

      <p> Because the training mode is built into the same application as the
      game, it seems like it would be possible to use in-game experience to
      objectively adjust training weights of anagram groups identified in game.
      Unfortunately, there are a number of reasons why this is difficult: </p>

      <ul>
        <li>training mode deals in anagram groups, not the individual words, and
          on a real board entire anagram groups are not always present</li>
        <li>missing a word on the board does not necessary imply it was not
          remember - real games have time pressure and the player may have
          simply prioritized other areas of the board to focus on</li>
        <li>games are not all played to exhaustion or even until the timer has
          expired and it is difficult to eliminate false negatives</li>
        <li>words may be easy to overlook on a board but also easy to solve in
          training (different modalities)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Instead the stats section was designed with the hopes of surfacing the
      same sorts of actionable information based on trying to use feedback from
      the game history.</p>

      <h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>

      <p>The main challenge with implementing Boggle is the size of the
      dictionary - ranging from ~180,000 - 280,000 words depending on which
      dictionary is used, even just the words themselves stored in a
      deterministic acyclic finite state automaton or an efficiently compressed
      trie still take up around 2MB. Furthermore, since the application shows
      definitions by default on successful entry of word it end up requiring the
      full dictionary anyway which balloons the size up 10-15x. Unfortunately,
      this has a large impact on initial startup as downloading a 30MB
      dictionary anywhere is going to be slow.</p>

      <p>If supporting offline was not a requirement the application could
      compute board solutions server side and send down only the required
      definitions and words for the game (or do point lookups on demand for
      something like define mode). Even with the need to support offline mode
      the initial download could be slightly optimized by shipping down just the
      encoded word data structure without definitions (and only for the specific
      dictionary configuration, given CSW is ~50% larger than the other two) so
      that the initial board could be solved and then shipping down definitions
      in a secondary download so that the user could begin playing immediately
      (racing the definitions download), however this approach was not chosen as
      either not showing the definitions before the second download has
      completed or blocking input on the board until the downloads are
      undesirable.</p>

      <p>As such, the best that can be done is attempting to hiding the latency
      (and the dreaded loading spinner UI) of the dictionary download by
      inserting the menu splash instead of dropping the user directly into a
      game and using the Service Worker API to cache the dictionary to make
      future loads as fast as possible. Given the number of features and modes
      supported by the application the menu as the loading screen isn’t actually
      a terrible UX decision, and if the user hesitates long enough on choosing
      where they wish to navigate to the entirety of the dictionary download may
      have time to finish in the background.</p>

      <p>Computing the training set or processing game history can also cause
      problems as they grow linearly. The training set thankfully grows fairly
      slowly because it is bound by human memory, though it is still relatively
      expensive to initially compute as it involves iterating through the
      entirety of the dictionary. Saving the history of each game played also is
      problematic as the longer a user uses the application the slower their
      experience will get, however, its possible to minimize this impact by
      bounding the amount of recent history we look at (eg. only looking at the
      last 500 games for stats) or by lazy loading (as is done in the past
      scoring breakdown).</p>

      <p>The application is currently fairly poorly implemented and a future
      rewrite in Typescript and Preact is planned - features and quick iteration
      have been prioritized above all else and the code quality reflects this.
